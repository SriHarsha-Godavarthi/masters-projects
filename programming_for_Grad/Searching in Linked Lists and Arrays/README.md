**Programming Assignment 1 Searching in Linked Lists and Arrays**

**Due Date:** September 21, 2023, 11:59 PM

**Objectives**
•	Creating linked lists
•	To practice add, delete, search, change and sort operations using linked lists and arrays
•	Practice developing high-performance solutions
•	Compare theoretical vs empirical complexities

**Problem Specification**
In reality, we always use various data structures to store data, and different data structures have different advantages and dis-advantages. For instance, some data structures are good at adding/deleting new data, but they may have deficiency on searching. From this assignment, let’s learn and compare the two basic data structures, namely linked lists and arrays, After the assignment is complete, you will know more about what are the real differences between these two data structures. 

Please follow the attached PDF file for detailed instruction.
Thanks.
